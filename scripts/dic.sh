# --- prompt-expansion widget --------------------------------------------
# This widget introduces a new syntax $$(...) for command substitution.
# When this widget encounters
#
#     $$(...)
#
# the line above will be replaced with
#
#     $ ...
#     $(...)
#
# This syntax is useful for constructing complex prompts using heredocs.
# For example:
#
#     dic <<EOF
#     $$(files-to-prompt src/)
#     $$(git diff HEAD~2)
#     $$(pytest)
#
#     Why did the previous commits cause these tests to fail?
#     EOF
#
# gets expanded to
#
#     dic <<EOF
#     $ files-to-prompt src/
#     $(files-to-prompt src/)
#     $ git diff HEAD~2
#     $(git diff HEAD~2)
#     $ pytest
#     $(pytest)
#
#     Why did the previous commits cause these tests to fail?
#     EOF
#
# The widget expansion happens immediately when the user presses enter.
# The $(...) is not run immediately and will be expanded by the shell like normal.
#
# NOTE:
# This widget expansion happens at the readline level.
# It will therefore expand *everywhere* in bash, and not just in heredocs.
# For example, it will expand in the standard repl and quoted heredocs <<'EOF'.
# This is unlikely to cause errors because $$(...) is never valid shell.
# The widget will never expand in non-interactive sessions.
