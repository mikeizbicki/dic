/* sandbox-seccomp.c -- the syscall filter sandbox4.sh installs.
 *
 * bwrap(1) cannot express a syscall policy: --seccomp takes a filter that is
 * already compiled.  This program is therefore the policy.  Run it with no
 * arguments and it writes one struct sock_filter array to stdout, which is
 * the exact shape bwrap reads back from the descriptor it is handed.  It
 * does nothing else, takes no options, and keeps no state.
 *
 * The filter allows by default.  A syscall that no rule names falls through
 * to SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW, so everything a normal program needs keeps working
 * and only what is listed below is refused.  A denial returns EPERM instead
 * of killing the process, so a program that needs one of these calls fails
 * in a way it can report, and a wall is never mistaken for a crash.  The
 * single exception is the architecture check, for the reason in build().
 *
 * The order of the rules is the part that is easy to get wrong.
 *
 *   1. The architecture, first.  Every rule after it compares a syscall
 *      number, and a syscall number means a different thing under a
 *      different ABI.  A payload from another ABI would be judged by
 *      numbers it does not use, so it is killed rather than filtered.
 *
 *   2. io_uring, next.  io_uring performs file and socket work in kernel
 *      context.  It does not call open(2) or socket(2), so a rule that
 *      watches those calls is walked around by it completely.  A filter
 *      that means to constrain a program by syscall has to close this hole
 *      before anything under it is worth having.
 *
 *   3. Everything else, which is kernel surface a payload has no use for
 *      and an exploit has plenty.
 *
 * Nothing here restricts which files can be opened.  That is the mount
 * map's job, in sandbox4.sh, and a file that was never mounted cannot be
 * named in the first place.
